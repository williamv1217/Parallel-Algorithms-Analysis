# Parallel Algorithms Project

Analysis of parallel algorithms for CS260 class in UC Riverside. 
I did analysis on runtimes and inputs for both mergesort and quicksort algorithms, using the CILK+ parallel language for C++

### Prerequisites

This project is run in a virtual setting using UCR computers that simulated a 24-core machine. It requires CILK+ to be installed on the local machine in order to use the CILK+ C++ language.

## Built With

* [CILK+](https://www.cilkplus.org) - The library used to do parallel C++ coding

## Authors

* **[William Vagharfard](https://williamv1217.github.io/my-cv/)**
